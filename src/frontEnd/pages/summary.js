                    <br/>I believe in hard work as well as enjoy what I do, trying to do things the best and more efficient way possible.
                    <br/> Nowadays, I want to take a step further in my career. 
                    I joined Kodiri Bootcamp to start learning new technologies and keep myself relevant.
                    I hope to find a job that allows me to continue this new career path.
